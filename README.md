# The Useless Box

A digital recreation of the classic useless machine — a box whose sole purpose is to turn itself off when you turn it on.

Built entirely with AI assistance because some things just need to exist.

## Try It

[Open the Useless Box](https://claudedidthis.github.io/Useless-Machine/)

Go on then. Flip the switch.
